A launcher app for home media servers.

Largely inspired by phone screens and the Android theming community. I'm making this because I wanted something nice and minimal to put on my projector for some ambience while I worked.

Features:
- [ ] Customizable home screens, including:
    - [X] Clock
    - [X] Weather (via OpenWeatherMap)
    - [X] Audio visualizer
    - [ ] Media player (via MPRIS2)
- [ ] Customizable launcher apps
- [ ] Remote controllable from a phone (over IP, no apps needed)
- [ ] Keystone correction (via `xrandr`)
